# Requirements

This mod requires the installation of [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/), the Celeste Mod Loader. It will not work without it.

# Quick start

### Usage

Download the latest release and place the .zip file in the `Mods` folder of your Celeste directory. Alternatively, use Everest's One-Click Installer through [Gamebanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/395489) or [Olympus](https://gamebanana.com/tools/download/6449).

### Development

Download the source code, unzip it so that all its contents are in a folder titled `SaveFileTotal`, and place in the `Mods` folder in the file directory of Celeste. The location of the file is important, as this mod is a C# class library dependent on the game executable.
